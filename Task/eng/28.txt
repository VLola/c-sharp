Project 28.

Task 1:
Given positive integers A, B, C.
The program should ask the user for the value of these numbers.
A rectangle of size A*B contains as many squares as possible with side C.
The squares do not overlap.
Find the number of squares placed on the rectangle, as well as the area of ​​the unoccupied part of the rectangle.
It is necessary to provide service messages in the event that
if no squares with side C can be placed in a rectangle
(for example, if the value of C is greater than the size of the sides of the rectangle).

Task 2:
The initial deposit in the bank is 10,000 UAH.
Every month the amount of the deposit increases by P
percent of the available amount
(P is a real number, 0 < P < 25).
The program must receive the value of P from the user.
According to this P, determine in how many months the amount of the deposit will exceed UAH 11,000,
and output the found number of months K (integer)
and the final size of the contribution S (real number).

Task 3:
Given positive integers A and B (A < B).
Output all integers from A to B inclusive;
each number should be displayed on a new line;
each number should be displayed the number of times,
equal to its value (for example, the number 3 is displayed 3 times). 
For example: if A = 3 and B = 7, then the program should generate the following output in the console:
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
6 6 6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7 7 7 7

Task 4:
Given an integer N greater than 0, find the number
obtained by reading the number N from right to left.
For example, if the number 345 was entered, then the program should output the number 543.
