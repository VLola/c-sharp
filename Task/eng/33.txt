Project 33.

Task 1:
Shapes app.

Write an application that will display the simplest geometric shapes selected by the user in the console:
"rectangle", "rhombus", "triangle", "trapezium", "polygon".
From the menu, the user selects the shapes and selects the colors for each shape.
Shapes are drawn with asterisks or other symbols.
To implement the program, it is necessary to develop a hierarchy.
classes (think about the possibility of abstraction).
All user-defined shapes are stored in the Generic Shape object,
which has a "display all selected shapes" method
