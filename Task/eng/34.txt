Project 34.

Task 1:
Develop an abstract class Geometric Shape with Shape Area and Shape Perimeter fields.
Develop child classes: Triangle, Square, Rhombus, Rectangle, Parallelogram, Trapezium,
Circle, Ellipse.
And implement properties that uniquely define the objects of these classes.
Implement the Simple N Square interface, which has the properties:
Height, Base, Angle Between Base and Adjacent Side, Number of Sides,
Side lengths, Area, Perimeter.
Implement a Composite Shape class that can consist of any number of Simple N Squares.
For this class, define a method for finding the area of ​​a figure.
Provide options for the impossibility of specifying a figure
(negative side lengths are entered, or when creating a triangle object, there is a pair of sides,
the sum of the lengths of which is less than the length of the third side, etc.)
