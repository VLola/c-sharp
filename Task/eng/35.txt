Project 35.

Task 1:
Write an application that will display the simplest geometric shapes specified by the user in the console.
The user selects a shape and sets its position on the screen, as well as the size and color using the menu.
All user-defined shapes are displayed simultaneously on the screen.
Shapes (rectangle, rhombus, triangle, trapezoid, polygon)
drawn with asterisks or other symbols.
To implement the program, it is necessary to develop a class hierarchy
(think about the possibility of abstraction).
To store all user defined shapes,
create a class "Collection of geometric shapes" with the method "Display all shapes".
To display all the shapes with the specified method, you need to use the foreach statement,
why in the class "Collection of geometric shapes" it is necessary to implement the appropriate interfaces.
