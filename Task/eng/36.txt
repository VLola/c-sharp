Project 36.

Task 1:
Develop your own structural data type to store the integer coefficients A and B of the linear equation A×X + B×Y = 0.
In the class, implement the static Parse() method,
which takes a string with the values ​​of the coefficients,
separated by comma or space.

Task 2:
Develop a method for solving a system of 2 linear equations:
A1×X + B1×Y = 0
A2×X + B2×Y = 0
The method, using output parameters, should return the found solution or error,
if no solution exists

Task 3:
Implement a class for storing a complex number.
In it, overload all the necessary operators to successfully compile the following code snippet:
Complexz = new Complex(1,1);
Complexz1;
z1 = z - (z * z * z - 1) / (3 * z * z);
Console.WriteLine("z1 = {0}", z1);

Task 4:
Develop a Fraction class that represents a simple fraction.
In the class, provide two fields: the numerator and denominator of the fraction.
Overload the following operators: +,-,*,/,==,!=,<,>, true, and false.
Arithmetic operations and comparison are performed in accordance with the rules for working with fractions.
The true operator returns true if the fraction is correct (the numerator is less than the denominator),
the false operator returns true if the fraction is not correct (the numerator is greater than the denominator).
Overload the operators necessary to successfully compile the following code snippet:
Fraction f = new Fraction(3, 4);
int a = 10;
Fraction f1 = f*a;
Fraction f2 = a*f;
double d = 1.5;
Fraction f3 = f + d;
