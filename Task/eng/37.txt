Project 37.

Task 1:
Write an application that will display the simplest geometric shapes specified by the user in the console.
The user selects a shape and sets its position on the screen,
as well as size and color using the menu.
All user-defined shapes are displayed simultaneously on the screen.
Shapes (rectangle, rhombus, triangle, trapezoid, polygon) are drawn with asterisks or other symbols.
To implement the program, it is necessary to develop a class hierarchy (think about the possibility of abstraction).
To store all user-defined shapes, create a Geometric Shapes Collection class with the Display All Shapes method.
To display all the shapes with the specified method, you need to use the foreach statement,
why in the class "Collection of geometric shapes" it is necessary to implement the appropriate interfaces.
