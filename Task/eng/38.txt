Project 38.

Task 1:
Write a Money class designed to store a sum of money (in hryvnias and kopecks).
Implement operator overloading for a class
+ (addition of monetary amounts)
â€“ (subtraction of sums)
/ (dividing the sum by an integer)
* (multiplying the sum by an integer)
++ (the amount increases by 1 kopeck)
-- (the amount is reduced by 1 kopeck)
<
>
==
!=
The class cannot contain a negative sum.
If the execution of any operation results in a negative amount of money,
then the class throws a Bankrupt exception.
The program should use the menu to demonstrate all the features of the Money class.
Exception handling is done in the program.
