Project 40.

Task 1:
Develop the Tamagotchi app.
The life cycle of a character is 1-2 minutes.
The character randomly issues requests (but the same request is not issued in a row).
Requests can be the following: Feed, Walk, Put to bed, Treat, Play.
If requests are not granted three times,
the character "gets sick" and asks him to be treated.
If it fails, it "dies".
The character is displayed in the console window using pseudo-graphics.
The dialogue with the character is carried out by calling the Show() method of the MessageBox class from the System.Windows.Forms namespace.
For more information on working with this method, contact your instructor or MSDN.
To solve this problem, you will need the Timer class from the System.Timers namespace, whose event is Elapsed,
delegate type ElapsedEventHandler, occurs after a certain time interval,
which is set in the Interval property.
The Start() and Stop() methods start and stop the timer, respectively.
You may also want to pause the application,
in this case, you can call the Sleep() method of the Thread class from the System.Threading namespace,
transferring the required number of milliseconds to it.
