Project 43.
Create an application for convenient reading of books.

On the start window in the form of a shelf of books, display everything.
 It should be possible to add a new one (with a random cover, from a txt file) or remove it.
 When you click on a specific one - open it in a separate window

In the reading window - display the opportunity
- page flipping forward/backward
- closing the book (the next time you open it, it should return to the same page)
- Voice over content
